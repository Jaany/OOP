<h1><mark>Terms and Conditions</mark></h1>
<p>
These terms and conditions, as may be amended from time to time, apply to all our services directly or indirectly (through distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email or by telephone. By accessing, browsing and using our website or any of our applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the "website") and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).
</p>
<h3><mark>Scope of our Service</mark></h3>
<p>
Through the website, we (Ticket.lk and its affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online platform through which bus service providers permitted by Nationa Transport Commission, Sri Lanka, can integrate their buses for reservation, and through which passengers to the website can make such reservations. By making a reservation through BusSeat.lk, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the bus service provider at which you book. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the provider, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant bus service provider and sending you a confirmation text for and on behalf of the bus service provider.

When rendering our services, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by bus service providers. As such, the bus service providers are given access to an account through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability and other information which is displayed on our website. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each bus service provider remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates and availability of seats) displayed on our website. Our website does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating of any buses made available.

Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our website for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.
